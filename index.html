    <h2>Football</h2>
    <br>
    <section>
        <h3>This is my favourite sport because when summer vacations were going and big boys played football every morning, then I thought that what are they playing and I searched that what the big boys were playing. Then I got to know that it is a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players â€“ field players and a goalkeeper.</h3>
